# Using Enconvo for Efficient Writing


Below are the features that I think are helpful for writing:

1.  Smart Bar: Allows you to invoke all of enconvo's functions from anywhere, similar to Raycast AI.
2.  Pop Bar: Allows you to quickly invoke functions after selecting text, similar to Popclip.
3.  Voice dictation: Allows you to input text via voice in any input box.
4.  Writing tools: The writing suite provides a series of pre-set tools that are helpful for writing.
    -   Fix Spelling and Grammar: Allows you to quickly check spelling and grammar.
    -   Summarize: Allows you to quickly summarize articles.
    -   Make Longer / Make Shorter: Allows you to quickly adjust the length of articles.
    -   And many other tools, or tools you define yourself.
