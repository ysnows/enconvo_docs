# Local & Privacy

:::note
**Local & Privacy** Enconvo provides local AI services, keeping user data on the local device and protecting user privacy.

## Why Local AI?

Cloud-based AI services can lead to the risk of user data leakage, and the stability and speed of the service cannot be guaranteed. Enconvo's local AI service can protect user data privacy and provide faster, more stable service.
