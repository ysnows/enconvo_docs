## Why Context Awareness?

An AI assistant should be able to react to its environment and provide different services based on the environment. Enconvo's Context Awareness feature is designed to achieve this goal.

## How to use Context Awareness?

- **Selected Text**: When you select text in any application, you can use the AI assistant to summarize the text, translate the text, or search for the text.
